# Contributing to blender-clone-tools
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Test your changes locally in Blender.
3. Follow the [Python code style guidelines](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).
4. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GNU General Public License v3.0
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GNU General Public License v3.0]([http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/)) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Note which version of Blender you are using
  - Specify which version of `blender-clone-tools` you are using
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (include screenshots and system console output if possible)
